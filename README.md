## Research Onramp - Learn Some Python
#### Weekly Coding Tutorials

#### Dr's Marcos Lopez and Terry Griffin

### Introduction

- My approach to introducing **Programming** for research is widely based on personal opinion and years of experience. However, programming for research has an infinite number of solutions, and almost all them are ok as long as your learning!  My approach in these meetings will give you skills beyond using a single software package to get the job done. It is a little `computer sciency` (yes that is a word) but you will all be better for it!
- Part of this approach is using the **Command Line** (even on windows). Sometimes running programs or installing libraries is better from the command line (well pretty much always better) :)
- This gives the user a better "feel" for the file system, and gives them the ability to install software or fix settings at a higher (or more expert) level. 
- More to come ...
