## Research Onramp - Learn Some Python
#### Weekly Coding Tutorials

# Not Done :) 

Sorry, all the files from the first week are available under the [Week-01](Week-01/README.md) folder. Everything else is in a partial state of chaos for right now. I DID comment all the code and organize it a little more for everyone. I hope we see you again! Next time I'll make my partner in crime show up: mathematics professor Dr. Marcos Lopez!

### Introduction

- My approach to introducing **Programming** for research is widely based on personal opinion and years of experience. However, programming for research has an infinite number of solutions, and almost all them are ok as long as your learning!  My approach in these meetings will give you skills beyond using a single software package to get the job done. It is a little `computer sciency` (it's a word!) but you will all be better for it!
- Part of my approach is using the **Command Line** (even on windows).
- This gives the user a better "feel" for the file system, and gives them the ability to install software or fix settings at a higher (or more expert) level. 
- More to come ... 

### Repo Files

- [Week-01](Week-01/README.md)
  - All the code from our first weeks meeting.
- [Week-02](Week-02/README.md)
  - All the code from our second weeks meeting.
- [Tutorials](Tutorials/README.md)
  - They aren't very complete, and we will work on completing more of them.
