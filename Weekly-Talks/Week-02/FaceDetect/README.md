## FaceDetect

- [face_detect.py](face_detect.py) reads in a folder of images and writes the output to another folder.

### Going Beyond

- If you want to mess with the code, you can use `sys.argv` (command line arguments) to tell the program which folder to read from and to write to.
- Use opencv to only write the faces (as new images) to your output folder. 
- Creating a json file, of where the faces where found for each image would be benefitial for future processing of the files.
