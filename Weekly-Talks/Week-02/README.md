## Research Onramp - CSV and Simple Face Detection
#### 02-22-2020 (Saturday @ 2:00 p.m.)

### Introduction

- This week we covered a simple face detection tutorial [here](FaceDetect/README.md). It is based on a tutorial from [realpython.com](https://realpython.com) in which we extended it to process a directory of files, and subsequently saving the processed images to a new folder.
- Then we started, but didn't get to [CsvStuff](CsvStuff/README.md). I did add some code to open a folder of csv files and count the number of lines in all of the files. There is not calculating of stats, or aggregations, but its a start to data processing.
